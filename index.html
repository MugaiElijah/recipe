	<h1>About Lemon Meringue</h1>
	<p>
		 Lemon Meringue is a single crusted pie. There are often debates on which is better, a pastry crust (used here) or a graham cracker crust. I will leave that up to you to decide. But for this recipe I'm using a pastry crust which does need to be prebaked because the lemon filling is made on the stove top and doesn't need to be baked in the oven.

This pie has been around for almost two centuries and we may think of it as homey and old fashioned, but it can be quite challenging to make. Some may have trouble with the lemon filling being too firm (like jelly) or too soft and runny, but this can be easily fixed by adjusting the amount of cornstarch used. (As a side note the difference between a lemon filling and a lemon curd is that a lemon filling contains cornstarch (corn flour). Another difference is that a lemon filling contains water and this is to give the filling more volume.) But the real problem seems to be with the meringue topping. Some have the problem of the meringue shrinking or even slipping right off the top of the pie. (These two problems can be solved by spreading the meringue right to the edges of the pie crust and by placing the meringue on a warm, not cold, lemon filling.) But what seems to bother people the most is that dreaded "weeping" (beads of moisture) that can form once the pie has cooled. Some see it on the top of the meringue, while others find it forming between the meringue and the lemon filling. Weeping on the top of the pie can be caused by over whipping the meringue. Weeping between the meringue and the filling can be caused from undercooking the meringue. I find the best solution is to make a Swiss Meringue as I feel it's more stable. A Swiss Meringue is different than just whipping the egg whites and sugar in a bowl. Instead the egg whites and sugar are first heated over a saucepan of simmering water which dissolves the sugar and heats the egg whites until very warm. I do recommend using a candy thermometer to ensure the egg whites reach 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) which is the temperature needed to kill salmonella. Once that is done the egg whites are simply whipped to stiff peaks, placed on the warm filling, and then all you need to do is brown the meringue either under a hot broiler or with a propane hand torch. No baking of the pie is needed. I find it best to let the pie sit a couple of hours after it's made so the filling has time to become firm enough to cut. If you like your Meringue Pie to be slightly chilled then you can place it in the refrigerator, uncovered, for a couple of hours before serving.
